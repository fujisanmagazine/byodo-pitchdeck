          <h3>Problems</h3>
          <p class="fragment">
            Social media and blogs have been created by individuals, but they
            are now evolving to a more professional quality, with blogs becoming
            articles, video postings becoming movies, and photo postings
            becoming sophisticated advertisements
          </p>
          <p class="fragment">
            Accordingly, the creation of content has become a team effort with a
            division of work, and a fair sharing of compensation for these
            creators is necessary
